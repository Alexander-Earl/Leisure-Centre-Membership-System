In order to get this project to run, a few things need to be installed.

1. Python 3.5
2. XAMPP
3. MySQL Workbench
4. Both libraries inside the 'Libraries' folder.

You then need to import the SQL Database from inside Workbench, enable the XAMPP MySQL connection and then run the 'MainApp.py' file.

Thanks,
Alexander
